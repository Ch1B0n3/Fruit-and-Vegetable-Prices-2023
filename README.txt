+ The PP-Suite reports a U.S. household’s costs to consume OTHER CATEGORIES of foods in addition to fruits and vegetables, such as meats, seafood, and cereal and bakery products. Food groupings in the PP-Suite are based on the USDA, Agricultural Research Service’s (ARS) Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS). This allows users to import price estimates for foods found in USDA dietary survey data. USDA, ARS’ FNDDS food groupings are BROADER than the specific food products priced for constructing this data product. They also include both conventional and organic products. For example, the PP-Suite average price to consume broccoli purchased raw is the average price paid for organic and conventional heads, crowns, and florets.
